# Website Change Monitor

This is a lightweight yet powerful project designed to monitor websites for changes. It leverages Python and Selenium to check for updates and includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automates the process on a defined schedule.

I use this project to track changes on my university portal for grade updates, but it can be adapted to monitor any website where tracking changes is important.

## Features
- Monitors a specified website for changes.
- Sends email notifications when changes are detected.
- Includes a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the monitoring process on a schedule.
- Flexible and easy to set up for your own use cases.

## Use Cases
- Monitoring a university portal for grade updates.
- Tracking updates to a blog or news page.
- Keeping an eye on price changes for a product.
- Monitoring any webpage for changes in content.

## How to Fork and Use This Project

### Step 1: Fork the Repository
1. Click the **Fork** button at the top-right corner of this repository to create your own copy.

### Step 2: Clone Your Forked Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/website-change-monitor.git
cd website-change-monitor
```

### Step 3: Create the `Test` Environment
1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Environments** in your forked repository.
2. Click **New environment** and name it `Test`.

### Step 4: Set Up Secrets
<ol>
<li>Generate the encryption secret. For that, run the following code:<br>
   Terminal: `pip3 install cryptography`, place in the venv if needed.<br>
   Script:<br>
<pre>
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
key = Fernet.generate_key()
print(key.decode())
</pre>
or just comment out these lines from the end.</li>
<li>Copy the generated code from the console to use it in the step 4.</li>
<li>Navigate to **Settings** > **Environments** > **Test** > **Add environment secret**.</li>
<li>Add the following secrets:

   | Secret Name      | Description                             |
   |------------------|-----------------------------------------|
   | `EMAIL`          | Your email address                     |
   | `EMAIL_PASSWORD` | Password or app-specific password for your email |
   | `LOGIN_USERNAME` | Username for the website to monitor     |
   | `LOGIN_PASSWORD` | Password for the website to monitor     |
   | `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Key, generated in Step 1                |
   </li>
<li>The workflow will start atomatically and the script will be run every 20 Minutes (you can find the runs under **Actions**), the time can be changed at .github/workflows/run_script.yml, line 5. </li>
</ol>

### Step 6: Allow Github Actions to read and write artefacts
It is needed to update content_file.txt every run.
For that, go to Settings -> Actions -> General -> Scroll to the bottom to 'Workflow permissions' and select 'Read and write permissions'.

### [optional] Step 7: Run the Workflow manually
1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository.
2. Select the **Run Python Script** Workflow at the top left and click **Run workflow** to start the monitoring process. Without it, the process

### Step 8: Set Up the Project to Test Locally

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**: Run `venv create` to set up a virtual environment.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Import the required packages by running `requirements.txt`.
3. **Add a `.env` File**: Create a file named `.env` and add your secrets in the following format:
   <pre>
   EMAIL='vika.vovchenkoo@gmail.com'
   EMAIL_PASSWORD='password from email address to send emails'
   LOGIN_USERNAME='login from the website'
   LOGIN_PASSWORD='password from the website'
   </pre>
4. **Run the Script**: Execute the script to test its functionality.
5. **Adapt to Your Needs**: Modify the script according to the documentation provided below.

## Technical Overview

### How the Project Works
The main script, `script.py`, orchestrates the entire process. Here's an outline of its functionality:

1. **Fetch Website Content**
   - The script logs into a website and retrieves the required elements.
   - For websites requiring authentication, login steps are included. If you do not need a login or any steps, you can remove lines 50â€“71 in the script.
   - Customize the steps based on your needs. You can add more URLs, steps, fields, or anything necessary to extract the desired data. Remove 'options=options' from line 42 to remove headless mode and allow to see the steps if needed.
   - For element selection, the script uses XPath. To find an XPath:
     - Open developer tools in your browser (F12).
     - Select the desired element.
     - Right-click and choose "Copy > XPath".
   - Update `XPATH_TRACK_AREA` to match the parent element containing the information you want to track (e.g., a price field, a feed, or a table with university marks).
   - Adjust `.github/workflows/run_script.yml` for your requirements:
     - Modify check intervals (line 5).
     - Update the GitHub environment name (line 11).
     - Configure environment variables (lines 79-82). If login isn't needed, remove those variables or add new ones if required.
   - Keep `.env` listed in `.gitignore` to prevent exposing sensitive data.

2. **Compare Content**
   - The script compares the current website content with the previous content stored locally.

3. **Save Content**
   - Any changes are saved to `content_file.txt`. The format it outerHTML of the parent element (`XPATH_TRACK_AREA`).
